description: 'Edith and Bruce Ottley live in a very new, very small, very white flat
  in Knightsbridge. On the surface they are like every other respectable couple in
  Edwardian London and that is precisely why Edith is beginning to feel a little bored.
  Excitement comes in the form of the dazzling and glamorous Hyacinth Verney, who
  doesn''t understand why Edith is married to one of the greatest bores in society.
  But then, Hyacinth doesn''t really understand any of the courtships, jealousies
  and love affairs of their coterie: why the dashing Cecil Reeve insists on being
  so elusive, why her loyal friend Anne is so stubbornly content with being a spinster,
  and why she just canÂ¡t seem to take her mind off love ...'
